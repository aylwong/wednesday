On week #5 we wrote most of our code and tests to implement the desired test parser.

In order to do this, first we had to:

-discuss the main flow of code 
-how to break the file and what to parse
-created a test methods and write code to parse lines on \r\n
-stubbed out the final functions to parse csv from strings 
-stuck on mapping each array of strings to parseCommas function (how do we loop, how to get the parsed strings and transform to an array )

next steps
-figure out how to loop over strings  
-work on larger files 
-finilize the source code and talk brainstorm ideas for next project
